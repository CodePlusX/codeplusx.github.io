			<p>We’re so excited for tomorrow’s Interaction Night! Last month’s hacknight was awesome — we had some great conversations and worked on cool stuff.</p>

<p>At our last event, we realized that a lot of attendees didn’t come with ideas prepared. So, we’ve come up with a few problems to solve in case you want to attend and don’t have something to work on yet. We’re going to list them here and print them out for the tomorrow’s event. Feel free to use these tomorrow or in the far future, we’d love to see your solution!</p>

<ol>
<li><h4>Air Travel</h4>

<p>Justine is a middle-class employee at a financial company. She just missed her flight from JFK Airport to San Francisco and is panicking. She doesn’t know what to do next and is frustrated; she woke up early and assumed she left the house on time, but didn’t predict that the train from her house and AirTrain would get her to JFK too late to board her plane. Google Maps was no help that morning since she was too panicked to keep checking if she was still on time. She would’ve taken a cab if she knew she would be late.</p></li>
<li><h4>Public Transportation</h4>

<p>Michael lives in Bayside, Queens and gets into Manhattan by taking one bus, transferring to another, then boarding the 7 train in Flushing. Recently, Google Maps has been suggesting a defunct bus route when he looks up directions. Michael ends up manually researching bus routes or guessing directions, which costs him a lot of extra time. He wishes there was an easier way to find his way around New York City.</p></li>
<li><h4>Pets</h4>

<p>Alicia has a cat named Marcy. Every time Alicia brings Marcy to the vet, she forgets to bring the cat passport she bought at her local pet store. The cat passport is quite useful: it lists all of Marcy’s vaccinations and previous medications. Alicia is generally too busy trying to force Marcy into a cat carrier to remember to find the cat passport before leaving her house. She wishes there were a way to carry this information and schedule vet appointments on her phone without calling someone, because she currently feels overwhelmed after starting a new job.</p></li>
<li><h4>Sexuality</h4>

<p>Veronica, once known as Vernon, had a very hard time coming out as transsexual. She wasn’t sure how to come out and felt very nervous and depressed. Gladly, she has a close friend who was there for her, but she always wanted a mentor to advise her during her transition. Her friend, Isis, is a closeted lesbian who feels very afraid of revealing her sexuality to her family. Veronica and Isis plan to move in together once they graduate from college; they want to support each other during their transformation into mature adults.</p></li>
<li><h4>Food</h4>

<p>Will is new to the world of food. As a child, he had a diet of basic canned foods and pasta. He just joined a CSA; most of the food he received is foreign to him, and though he asked the CSA about the food he received, they weren’t very clear. In addition, when he goes to restaurants with his girlfriend, he often doesn’t know what items on the menu are. Will wishes there were a simpler way to look up food without having to Google, especially when his phone loses reception.</p></li>
<li><h4>Friends</h4>

<p>Amanda has a close group of friends that she often spends her time with. Unfortunately, the new Facebook group she created isn’t making life easier for them. Amanda and her friends just entered the workforce and have different schedules; the six of them often forget to tell each other when they’re traveling or too busy to hang out. Many times, plans fall through because several people forget about previous plans. Amanda often feels frustrated with her friends, but misses them immensely and understands what they’re going through.</p></li>
<li><h4>Plants</h4>

<p>Patrick loves plants and recently got a full-time sales job. He never remembers to feed or water the plants that sit on his window sill. He has a small Japanese bonsai and a few organic tomato and basil plants, all of which require specific treatment. Patrick plans to buy a few more plants and wishes there were an easier way to keep track of his current plants, as well as plan the care of his future ones.</p></li>
<li><h4>RSS Feed</h4>

<p>Tess loves reading and subscribes to an endless number of RSS feeds. Google’s announcement regarding the closure of Reader left her devastated and frustrated. In her desperation, she tried Feedly, a well-liked RSS feed reader, but thought it was too focused on photos rather than words. She wants a feed reader that’s less like a magazine and more like a book. Some features were close enough to reader, though, so she’s going with Feedly until something better comes up.</p></li>
